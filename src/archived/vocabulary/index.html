			Langugage, and more broadly the different mediums we use for communication <strong>are bloomin awesome.</strong> Its hard to really get across the
			level of emphasis i'm trying to embody that sentence with purely with a text based medium such as this, so let me say this a second time so I can 
			really sell you on this: 	<span class="emphasis">Language is bloody awesome!</span>
			yes, I really made a new spanstyle for that specific line, thats how much I care.<br><br>

			This pages purpose is far more begnin and jokey then alot of the others on this site even if the subject is one I have alot of passion for.
			I simply wanted a place to store language I enjoy. Also the english language is a red hot rod of steel fresh from the furnace that can be moulded and shaped
			with your own two hands! its really fun and you should deffinitely try it!

			<br><br><strong>Words I adore</strong><br>
			Felicity (not the name!), Gondola, Chickadee, Gorgonzola, Tandem, 

			<br><br><strong>Phrases I love</strong><br>		
			thats a "winner of a dinner" right there,  I'm a QUEENSLANDAAR, He's been doing alot for me lately so I have to return the flavour somehow!, Things can slip
			out of your hands but you can allways pick them back up :),
			
			<br><br><strong>Homemade words</strong><br>
